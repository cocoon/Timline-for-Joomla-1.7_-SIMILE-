<H1>Timeline Basics</H1>
<P>A timeline contains one or more <EM><A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/bands.html">bands</A></EM>,
which can be panned infinitely by dragging with the mouse pointer. A
band can be configured to synchronize with another band such that
panning one band also scrolls the other. 
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../components/com_timeline/images/band.jpg" NAME="Grafik1" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=304 HEIGHT=72 BORDER=0>A
timeline is implemented as a div element that contains inner div
elements as its bands (right). The band divs are cropped and
positioned relative to the timeline div. 
</P>
<P>A band div itself contains several inner elements that implements
various parts of the band. For example, the two timelines above show
labels for days, weeks, months, and years. The bands also have
different background colors, and the weekly band of the second
timeline has weekend markings. All of these visual elements are
&quot;painted&quot; by adding HTML elements to the band divs at the
appropriate positions. 
</P>
<P>As a band is panned, its div is shifted horizontally or
vertically, carrying all of its visual elements along. When either
end of the band div approaches the visible (non-cropped) area, the
band div is re-centered, its coordinate origin is changed, and then
its various visual elements are re-&quot;painted&quot; relative to
the new coordinate origin. All of this &quot;paging&quot; is done as
seamlessly as possible so that the user experiences smooth, <EM>infinite</EM>
panning. 
</P>
<P>A band is responsible for supporting panning as well as
coordinating its various sub-components: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">an <EM><A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/ethers.html">ether</A></EM>,
	whose sole responsibility is mapping between pixel coordinates and
	dates/times; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">an <EM><A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/ether-painters.html">ether
	painter</A></EM>, which paints date/time labels and the background
	of the band as well as the highlight (the lighter part of the lower
	band in the first timeline above); 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">zero or more <EM><A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/decorators.html">decorators</A></EM>,
	which further decorate the background of the band; and 
	</P>
	<LI><P>an <EM><A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/event-painters.html">event
	painter</A></EM>, which paints the events. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The band also takes an <EM><A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/event-sources.html">event
source</A></EM> which provides events to be displayed in that band.
Different bands can have different event sources. This flexibility
allows for <EM>timeline mashups</EM>, as exemplified <A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/examples/religions/religions.html">here</A>.
Various sub-components that do painting take a <EM><A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/docs/themes.html">theme</A></EM>,
which stores default visual and behavioral settings.
